The error indicates that GitHub no longer supports password-based authentication for pushing to repositories using HTTPS. Instead, GitHub now requires you to use one of the following authentication methods:

1. **Personal Access Token (PAT)**: This is the most common approach for HTTPS.
2. **SSH Key**: This method allows you to authenticate via SSH instead of HTTPS.

Here’s how you can resolve this issue:

---

### **Solution 1: Use a Personal Access Token (PAT)**

1. **Generate a Personal Access Token:**
   - Go to your GitHub account: [GitHub Personal Access Token Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
   - Click **"Generate new token"**.
   - Select the necessary scopes (e.g., `repo` for repository access).
   - Click **"Generate token"** and copy the token. _Keep it secure!_

2. **Use the Token Instead of a Password:**
   - When Git asks for a username and password:
     - Enter your GitHub username as usual.
     - Paste the token as the password.

3. **Update Your Remote URL:**
   If you don't want to be prompted for a username and token every time, you can store the token in your Git remote URL:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://<your_username>:<your_token>@github.com/AdnanNisar168/Mern-6-Packs.git
   ```

   Replace `<your_username>` with your GitHub username and `<your_token>` with your PAT.

### **Solution 2: Use SSH for Authentication**

1. **Generate an SSH Key:**
   If you haven’t already set up an SSH key, generate one:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

   Press **Enter** to accept the default location and optionally set a passphrase.

2. **Add the SSH Key to GitHub:**
   - Copy your public key:
     ```bash
     cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
     ```
   - Go to your GitHub account: [GitHub SSH Settings](https://github.com/settings/keys).
   - Click **"New SSH key"**, paste the key, and save.

3. **Update Your Remote URL to Use SSH:**
   Change the remote URL for your repository:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:AdnanNisar168/Mern-6-Packs.git
   ```

4. **Test the Connection:**
   Test the SSH connection to GitHub:
   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```

5. **Push Your Changes:**
   Push to the repository using SSH:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### **Recommendation**
If you’re already using HTTPS, the PAT method is quick and easy to set up. For a more permanent and secure solution, consider switching to SSH authentication.
